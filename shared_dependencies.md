1. "Agent": This is the main class that will be used across all files. It will be defined in "agent.py" and used in other files to create an agent, use the LLM model, and manage persistent memory.

2. "LLM Model": This is the local LLM model that the agent will use. It will be defined in "local_llm_model.py" and used in "agent.py" to enable the agent to use the model.

3. "Persistent Memory": This is the memory system that will store the conversations. It will be defined in "persistent_memory.py" and used in "agent.py" and "conversation.py" to store and retrieve conversation data.

4. "Conversation": This is the class that will handle the conversations. It will be defined in "conversation.py" and used in "agent.py" and "persistent_memory.py" to manage conversations and store them in memory.

5. "Agent ID": This is the unique identifier for each agent. It will be used in all files to identify the agent.

6. "Conversation ID": This is the unique identifier for each conversation. It will be used in "conversation.py" and "persistent_memory.py" to identify and store conversations.

7. "Model ID": This is the unique identifier for the LLM model. It will be used in "agent.py" and "local_llm_model.py" to identify and use the model.

8. "Memory ID": This is the unique identifier for the persistent memory. It will be used in "agent.py" and "persistent_memory.py" to identify and use the memory.

9. "createAgent()": This function will be defined in "agent.py" and used in other files to create an agent.

10. "loadModel()": This function will be defined in "local_llm_model.py" and used in "agent.py" to load the LLM model.

11. "storeConversation()": This function will be defined in "persistent_memory.py" and used in "conversation.py" and "agent.py" to store conversations.

12. "retrieveConversation()": This function will be defined in "persistent_memory.py" and used in "conversation.py" and "agent.py" to retrieve conversations.

13. "startConversation()": This function will be defined in "conversation.py" and used in "agent.py" to start a conversation.

14. "DOM Element IDs": These are the IDs of the DOM elements that the JavaScript functions will use. They will be used in all files to interact with the user interface.
